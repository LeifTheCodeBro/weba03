                            Firstly, if all you need is a simple check up because your computer in one way or another is
                            being frustruating, then I will be glad to take a look at it and make sure its in working
                            order and I will recomend you steps going forward if any are needed.<br><br><a

                            The next tier of service I provide is advising. If you were thinking on buying a new
                            computer and you aren't really sure which computer is best for you, then I will help you
                            make the best decision and give you advice/stategies to help you going forwards.<br><br><a

                            Another service I offer is being able to help you build your own computer. I will look at
                            what you have so far and I will ask you a few questions to get to better understand what the
                            computer will be used for. This is so that I will be able to best make recomendations to
                            maximize how much value you get for the dollar.<br><br><a href="#info3">Custom Build

                            Finally, my last sevice is building you a custom computer myself. All you will have to
                            provide is a budget, and what your computer is for. I will also take into account any
                            preferences and your own recomendations/choices, when building the computer.<br><br><a

                            For the Tier 1 support, my main focus will be to try an figure out what's wrong with you
                            computer and try to fix it. But if I think some changes will need to be made, then that's
                            something I will advise.<br><br>
                            I offer both online and in-person service within this Tier. For further information about

                            The Tier 2 support is less about helping you with your computer issues, and more focused on
                            helping you choose your new computer or new computer parts. This tier is here because when
                            it comes to buying new computers and computer parts, it gets very complex very fast, when it
                            really shouldn't be. I will help you pick out the perfect computer or computer part for your
                            needs.<br><br>
